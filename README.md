## Project Overview
ConnectTel Telecom Company faces the pressing need to address customer churn, which poses a significant threat to its business sustainability and growth.
The company's current customer retention strategies lack precision and effectiveness, resulting in the loss of valuable customers to competitors.
This project aims to develop a robust customer churn prediction system by leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques on available customer data to accurately forecast customer churn and implement targeted retention initiatives.
This proactive approach will enable ConnectTel to reduce customer attrition, enhance customer loyalty, and maintain a competitive edge in the highly dynamic and competitive telecommunications industry.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was provided by 10Alytics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Provides insights into customer behavior, correlations, and visualization of churn patterns.
 
## Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were used before feeding the data into the machine learning model.
1. Handling missing values
2. Scaling the numerical variables
3. Encoding categorical variables

## Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model was built using the supervised learning approach. Data was split into training and test datasets. Several classification models were tested, including
    - **Logistic regression** 
    - **Random Forest** 
    - **SDG classifier** 

## Evaluation Metrics
To access the performance of the machine learning model, the following evaluation metrics were used:

- **Accuracy:** The overall proportion of correctly predicted likelihood of customer churn

## Key Insights
- The purpose of the project is to develop a robust customer churn prediction system
- The Random forest classifier performs better than other models tested, with an accuracy of 99.91%  

## Conclusion
The Customer Churn Prediction System is an robust machine learning algorithm that is capable of forecasting and predicting customer churn. This will enable the company to understand the trend and implement targeted retention initiatives.
